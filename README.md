## Introduction

The DEX Smart Contract enables users to trade ERC20 tokens on a decentralized platform. It's designed to provide a secure, transparent, and efficient way to exchange tokens within the Ethereum ecosystem.

## Enums and Structs

- **Side**: Represents the side of the trade (BUY or SELL).
- **Token**: Defines token information, including ticker and address.
- **Order**: Represents a trading order with various attributes.

## State Variables

- `tokens`: A mapping of token tickers to token information.
- `tokenList`: An array of available token tickers.
- `traderBalances`: Tracks the token balances of traders.
- `orderBook`: Stores the order book data.
- `admin`: Address of the contract administrator.
- `nextOrderId`: Auto-incrementing ID for orders.
- `nextTradeId`: Auto-incrementing ID for trades.
- `DAI`: Ticker for DAI token.

## Events

- `NewTrade`: Fired when a trade is executed.

## Constructor

Initializes the contract and sets the admin address.

## Functions

- `getOrders`: Retrieves orders for a given token and side.
- `getTokens`: Retrieves information about available tokens.

- `deposit`: Enables users to deposit tokens into their trading balance.
- `withdraw`: Allows users to withdraw tokens from their balance.
- `createLimitOrder`: Users can create limit orders for trading.

  createLimitOrder("ETH", 1, 2500, Side.BUY);
  ```

  ```solidity
  deposit(100, "ETH");
  ```
